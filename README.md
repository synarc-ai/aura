# AURA & ψ-System: Unified Framework for Artificial General Intelligence

## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains two interconnected theoretical frameworks for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):

- **AURA** - Adaptive Unified Resonant Architecture: A practical implementation framework for AGI systems
- **ψ-System** - Universal Metatheory of Meaning: Theoretical foundation for understanding consciousness and semantics

Together, they form a complete theoretical and practical approach to creating systems with genuine understanding, not just computational competence.

## 📚 Documentation

### AURA: Adaptive Unified Resonant Architecture

AURA provides a practical, implementable architecture for AGI systems with:

- **Mathematical Rigor**: Category theory and quantum formalism foundations
- **Safety Guarantees**: Provable safety properties and failure mode analysis
- **Implementation Ready**: TypeScript and Rust specifications with clear roadmap
- **Adaptive Evolution**: Continuous learning and self-improvement capabilities

[Read AURA Documentation →](./docs/aura/ru/README.md)

Key sections:
- Theoretical Foundations (Category Theory, Quantum Formalism)
- Mathematical Framework
- Safety and Resilience Analysis
- Implementation Specifications (TypeScript & Rust)
- Practical Benchmarks and Trade-offs

### ψ-System: Universal Metatheory of Meaning

The ψ-System provides deep theoretical foundations for understanding:

- **Semantic Fields**: How meaning emerges and transforms
- **Subject Architecture**: Mathematical formalization of consciousness
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Life cycles of meaning and semantic gravity
- **Practical Applications**: Therapy, pedagogy, and consciousness engineering
